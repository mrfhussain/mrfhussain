**`Cloud Engineer (DataEngineer/DevOps/PowerBI)`**

By title I am a Cloud Engineer, by practicality I'm still thinking about that because I have done a few things that could put me in a category of DevOps, some could argue I have done aspects of Software development too.
From using Excel for Data Analysis to reviewing code in React, I have been exposed to many aspects. 

My tech experience started from using using Excel to automate processes as well as analyse data - this was during my teaching years - and then using SQL and PowerBI, and now I am doing a whole range of awesome projects, like optimising assets made from bricks and glue! 
I have been introduced to some remarkable people and technologies, and I can only hope this journey continues to grow - beit through different experiences at varied organisations or through roles needing adaptability.

### üß∞ Languages and Tools
There are some missing form the list below, like ** Dagster (Python)** - I'm still looking for good icons for these :)
**I'll start of with with tools and languages etc that I have used and would say are my areas of `weaknesses` of `areas needing development`**

 <summary><h3>üë®‚Äçüíª Farhad's Coding Journey</h3></summary>
   I started my coding journey as a naive Mathematics student with a passion to learn everything I could about this technological world - mechanical engineering, aerospace, physics, finance, philosophy (obviously Mathematics), coding - you name it, I probably wanted to learn it. And all the while, trying to get the top grades for my BSc in Mathematics. Trying to learn everything soon got overshadowed by my desire to travel and also I met an amazing woman, got married, travelled, had children and as a teacher I was able to better balance all this. Eventually, in the midst of all the chaos, I managed to learn SQL, Python and PowerBI. However, my desire to keep on enhancing kept on calling, so even after some roles involving teaching with responsibilities in Data and Tech, I wanted to keep going. I eventually ended up quitting teaching to pursue greater challenges, and that has been my focus ever since. But there's something that's always bothered me about my journey - abandoning my dream of always learning and trying different routes to pursue the safe route, a stable job. Now I've already taken the leap away from that safety net into this uncomfortable, unexplored world that is working in a fast-paced and ever evolving world of tech. And it worked out, but again, it is starting to become comfortable. It's easier to contribute to a product than go out on a ledge and build my own product or a product from scratch or just simply explore how different organisation get things done, right now any of these experiences would be a welcomed challenge.

**`Cloud Engineer (DataEngineer/DevOps/PowerBI)`**

By title I am a Cloud Engineer, by practicality well, still thinking about that... From the Excel days of formulae and pivot tables to coding in Python and designing dashboards, I have been a part of a breadth of projects in these short years...

 <summary><h3>👨‍💻 Farhad's Coding Journey</h3></summary>
   I started my coding journey as a naive Mathematics student with a passion to learn everything I could about this technological world - mechanical engineering, aerospace, physics, finance, philosophy (obviously Mathematics), coding - you name it, I probably wanted to learn it. And all the while, trying to get the top grades for my BSc in Mathematics. Trying to learn everything soon got overshadowed by my desire to travel and also I met an amazing woman, got married, travelled, had children and as a teacher I was able to better balance all this. Eventually, in the midst of all the chaos, I managed to learn SQL, Python and PowerBI. However, my desire to keep on enhancing kept on calling, so even after some roles involving teaching with responsibilities in Data and Tech, I wanted to keep going. I eventually ended up quitting teaching to pursue greater challenges, and that has been my focus ever since. But there's something that's always bothered me about my journey - abandoning my dream of always learning and trying different routes to pursue the safe route, a stable job. Now I've already taken the leap away from that safety net into this uncomfortable, unexplored world that is working in a fast-paced and ever evolving world of tech. And it worked out, but again, it is starting to become comfortable. It's easier to contirnute to a product than go out on a ledge and build my own product or a product from sctach for others, right now any of these experiences would be a welcomed challenge. I do have to eat, at the end of the day, but I think it's time. It's time to get uncomfortable again. I have a burning desire to get back on the horse, and fulfill that dream younger me had of building products. And in order to do that, I'll be implmementing a few measured chnages and am always a believer in what is best for you Allah (God) will guide you - for that I say Alhumdulillah.
